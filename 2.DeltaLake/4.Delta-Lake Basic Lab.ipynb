Tables are equivalent to Apache Spark DataFrames.\n\nGenerally, the distinction between tables and DataFrames in Spark can be summarized by discussing scope and persistence:\n- Tables are defined at the **workspace** level and **persist** between notebooks.\n- DataFrames are defined at the **notebook** level and are **ephemeral**.\n\nWhen we discuss **Delta tables**, we are always talking about collections of structured data that persist between notebooks. Importantly, we do not need to register a directory of files to Spark SQL in order to refer to them as a table. The directory of files itself _is_ the table; registering it with a useful name to Spark SQL just gives us easy accessing to querying these underlying data.\n\nA **Delta Lake** can be thought of as a collection of one or many Delta tables. Generally, an entire elastic storage container will be dedicated to a single Delta Lake, and data will be enriched and cleaned as it is promoted through pre-defined logic.\n\n<img alt=\"Best Practice\" title=\"Best Practice\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.3em\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-blue-ribbon.svg\"/> To make Delta tables easily accessible, register them using Spark SQL.
